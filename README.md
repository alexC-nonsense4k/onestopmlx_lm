## Development Plan

Moving forward, we plan on making the following developments:

### 1. Optimize Code Structure

We plan to optimize the code structure to improve the readability and maintainability of the code. This will make it easier for other developers to understand how the code works and make necessary modifications.

### 2. Support Front-End Display of Loss Changes During Training

We also plan to support front-end display of loss changes during training. This will allow users to visually see the process of model training and the improvement of model performance.

### 3. New Page to Launch Trained Models Directly

We also plan to develop a new page where users can directly launch trained models. This will make it easier for users to use our models without the need for complex settings and configurations.


And SO ON AND ON AND ON~~~~~~~
